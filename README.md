Azure provisioning and things with Ansible

Bits and pieces as I become familiar with Azure, and using Ansible to provision things in it.

## December 2018 update

So unfortunately while working with Azure during company hours, we were asked to attach copyrights to all of our github (enterprise) repos, so I can't directly share what I've put together internally, which is a bit of a shame.

I need to look into what would make my playbooks exempt from copyright if I re-write them, then I should be able to update this repo some more.
